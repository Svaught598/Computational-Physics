# Computational-Physics

### About

This is a collection of programming assignments completed throughout 
a graduate level computational physics course. Many problems are from 
the book 'Computational Physics' by Mark Newman, and some are from 
the instructor (Matt Wood) directly. Pretty much just made this repo
so that I could compare my code with other students work much more easily 
(and vice versa). 

### Material Covered

There was a lot of material covered through this course; we actually finished the book
halfway through the semester and started doing other things. Some of the material discussed:

* Numerical Integration
* Derivatives of Discrete Data
* Solutions to Linear Equations (Matrices)
* Solutions to Nonlinear Equations 
* Fourier Techniques
* Solutions to Ordinary Differential Equations
* Solutions to Boundary Value Problems
* Random Processes and Monte Carlo Techniques

### Python Libraries Used

* NumPy
* MatPlotLib
* SciPy
* Numba
